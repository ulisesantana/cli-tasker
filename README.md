# tasker

I have tried some task managers during last 10 years so I think is time to build one by myself.

Right now the database for the tasks is a Google Spreadsheet. So you will need to share your spreadsheet with `tasks-536@cli-tasker.iam.gserviceaccount.com` and paste the spreadsheet ID on your first init. 

P.D. : `notes.md` is for write my drafts about the project, so is in spanish.
